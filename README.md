## Pizza Menu
For the projects, I created an interactive pizza menu to order various selections of toppings using vanilla JavaScript.
By taking the input information and calculating the price of the order.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
* The classic game of tic tac toe using basic JavaScript and HTML.<br>
This was very fun and interesting to make. Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game on a board with 3 x 3 squares with a random roll of dice to select which player goes first and place a mark of their choice on the board.
The first player to match 3 symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3 x 3 grid wins and will be rewarded with music and flashing lights. 

## Calculator
* A simple calculator for general purposes.<br>
A basic 4 function calculator, that can be used to add, divide, subtract, and multiply  on a web version.
